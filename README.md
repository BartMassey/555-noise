# 555 Noisemaker
Bart Massey 2013-02-04

This circuit is the "[Laser Ray
Sound](http://www.555-timer-circuits.com/laser-ray-sound.html)"
from <http://555-timer-circuits.com>,
layed out in [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org) and
available under the "MIT License" (see the file COPYING in
this distribution for license terms).

There is a BOM file and Gerber artwork checked in, for those
who want to skip the KiCAD step. The parts are all from
Digikey, and have Digikey part numbers; unfortunately I
haven't yet figured out how to get KiCAD to take those
numbers.
